            <h2>History</h2>
            <p><strong>Dew Valley Foods is a family owned business with origins in the butchery trade, they started as craft butchers in Thurles selling beef and pork products to the local community. The  business focussed its development in pork and bacon and in  1993 the company moved to its current site where we started cooking bacon products for the ‘food to go’ and Quick Service Restaurant market.</strong></p>
            <p>Dew Valley Foods cures all of it own streaky bacon allowing us to be highly innovative when it comes to taste and flavour. We use only natural ingredients where possible and massage these ingredients into the meat during the curing process.</p>
            <p>Dew Valley Foods were the first company in Europe to introduce microwave technology to cook bacon, and over the years this technology has been pivotal in the growth of our business as it delivers the consistent quality and the correct functionality for the cooked bacon market.</p>
